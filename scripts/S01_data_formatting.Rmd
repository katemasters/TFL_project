## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r import}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)


setwd("C:/Users/katem/OneDrive - University of Cambridge/Summer Project 25/TFL_project/data")

raw_data <- read_csv("TFL_raw_data.csv")
head(raw_data)

```
```{r survive and fertile}
raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(prop_survived = survived_recovery / pop_size,
        prop_fertile = fertile / no_crossed_w_LHM)
print(raw_data)
```
The code above only looks at male survival after the recovery period, and ignores whether males died after the 24 hr cross, so trying this: 



```{r survive and fertile alternate}

raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(x = survived_24hr_cross / no_crossed_w_LHM, 
        likely_survived = x * survived_recovery, 
        prop_survived_2 = likely_survived / pop_size,
        prop_fertile_2 = fertile / survived_24hr_cross)
print(raw_data)

```
```{r compare f}
print(
  data.frame(
    prop1 = raw_data$prop_fertile,
    prop2 = raw_data$prop_fertile_2
  )
)

```

```{r compare s}
print(
  data.frame(
    prop3 = raw_data$prop_survived,
    prop4 = raw_data$prop_survived_2
  )
)

```

```{r save data}


```
