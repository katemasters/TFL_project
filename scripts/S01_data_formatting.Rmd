## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r import}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)


setwd("C:/Users/katem/OneDrive - University of Cambridge/Summer Project 25/TFL_project/data")

raw_data <- read_csv("TFL_raw_data.csv")
head(raw_data)



```
```{r survive and fertile}
raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(prop_survived = survived_recovery / pop_size,
        prop_fertile = fertile / no_crossed_w_LHM)
print(raw_data)
```
The code above only looks at male survival after the recovery period, and ignores whether males died after the 24 hr cross, so trying this: 



```{r survive and fertile alternate}

raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(x = survived_24hr_cross / no_crossed_w_LHM, 
        likely_survived = x * survived_recovery, 
        prop_survived_2 = likely_survived / pop_size,
        prop_fertile_2 = fertile / survived_24hr_cross)
print(raw_data)



raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(fertile = if_else(genotype == "tT" & temp_stress == 25, 
                           NA_real_, fertile))

```
```{r compare f}
print(
  data.frame(
    prop1 = raw_data$prop_fertile,
    prop2 = raw_data$prop_fertile_2
  )
)

```

```{r compare s}
print(
  data.frame(
    prop3 = raw_data$prop_survived,
    prop4 = raw_data$prop_survived_2
  )
)
```

```{r save data}

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# First calculate flags per group BEFORE uncount
expanded_data <- raw_data %>%
  # Keep counts as-is for flag calculation after expansion
  mutate(
    survived_recovery_flag_count = survived_recovery,
    crossed_flag_count = no_crossed_w_LHM,
    survived_24hr_flag_count = survived_24hr_cross,
    fertile_flag_count = fertile
  ) %>%
  # Expand rows by population size
  uncount(weights = pop_size) %>%
  group_by(genotype, bloc, temp_stress) %>%
  mutate(
    fly_id = row_number(),
    survived_recovery_flag = ifelse(fly_id <= first(survived_recovery_flag_count), 1, 0),
    crossed_flag = ifelse(fly_id <= first(crossed_flag_count), 1, 0),
    survived_24hr_flag = ifelse(fly_id <= first(survived_24hr_flag_count), 1, 0),
    fertile_flag = ifelse(fly_id <= first(fertile_flag_count), 1, 0)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Remove the old columns used for counts
  select(-survived_recovery, -no_crossed_w_LHM, 
         -survived_24hr_cross, -fertile,
         -survived_recovery_flag_count, -crossed_flag_count, 
         -survived_24hr_flag_count, -fertile_flag_count)
