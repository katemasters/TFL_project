## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/katem/OneDrive - University of Cambridge/Summer Project 25/TFL_project/data")

raw_data <- read_csv("TFL_raw_data.csv")
head(raw_data)

raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(prop_survived = survived_recovery / pop_size,
        prop_fertile = fertile / no_crossed_w_LHM)
print(raw_data)

raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(x = survived_24hr_cross / no_crossed_w_LHM, 
        likely_survived = x * survived_recovery, 
        prop_survived_2 = if_else(survived_24hr_cross == 0 & no_crossed_w_LHM == 0, 
                              0, 
                              likely_survived / pop_size),
        prop_fertile_2 = fertile / (survived_24hr_cross + mdeath_in_fertile_vial))
print(raw_data)

raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(fertile = if_else(genotype == "tT" & temp_stress == 25, 
                           NA_real_, fertile))

head(raw_data)

```

```{r}
full_model <- glm(cbind(fertile, 
                        survived_24hr_cross + mdeath_in_fertile_vial - fertile) ~ 
                    genotype + temp_stress + temp_development +
                    stress_time_hr + recovery_time_hr + pop_size + sex_ratio,
                  family = binomial,
                  data = raw_data)

library(MASS)
step_model <- stepAIC(full_model, direction = "both")
summary(step_model)

```
the results above are the equivalent of the model for prop_fertile_2 (it just has to be in count form, not already a proportion)
